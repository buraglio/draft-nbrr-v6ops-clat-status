1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Terminology

   PLAT: As defined in [RFC6877], PLAT is provider-side translator
   (XLAT) that complies with [RFC6146].  It translates N:1 global IPv6
   addresses to global IPv4 addresses, and vice versa.

   CLAT: As defined in [RFC6877], CLAT is customer-side translator
   (XLAT) that complies with [RFC6145].  It algorithmically translates
   1:1 private IPv4 addresses to global IPv6 addresses, and vice versa.
   The CLAT function is applicable to a router or an end-node such as a
   mobile phone.  The CLAT should perform IP routing and forwarding to
   facilitate packets forwarding through the stateless translation even
   if it is an end-node.  The CLAT as a common home router or wireless
   Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) router is expected to
   perform gateway functions such as being a DHCP server and DNS proxy
   for local clients.  The CLAT uses different IPv6 prefixes for CLAT-
   side and PLAT-side IPv4 addresses and therefore does not comply with
   the sentence "Both IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and
   IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the same prefix." in
   Section 3.3 of [RFC6052].  The CLAT does not facilitate
   communications between a local IPv4-only node and an IPv6- only node
   on the Internet.
